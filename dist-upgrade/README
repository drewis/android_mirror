On new releases (Cause i already forgot once)

1. regen evervolv mirror, resync evervolv and aosp mirror
2. ./pull-ev-aosp-grouped-projects-from-manifest.py
	against old manifest to get projects we need to push the new release branch to
3. ./find-projects-with-specific-branch.py
	for old branch to get projects that we have not abandoned
4. ./find-projects-needing-new-branch.py
	to get projects not in aosp that will need the new branch

So new we have a list of aosp projects we have forked and a list of
non aosp projects we are still working on.

5. remove any projects for the lists we don't need anymore
6. grab the new manifest from aosp
7. ./set-remote-and-revision-on-aosp-manifest.py
	on new manifest to prep for evervolv
8. ./remove-github-hosted-projects-from-aosp-manifest.py
	more prep for evervolv
9. review changes to manifest against list ev-aosp-projects.txt
10. copy github stuff from old manifest to new manifest

Manifest is now updated

11. push new aosp branch for projects in ev-aosp-projects.txt to github
	./push-ev-aosp-projects-to-gerrit.py
12. fork projects in repos-with-current-branch.txt with new branch
	for ii in $(cat /home/drewis/pro
jects-need-new-branch.txt ); do pushd ${ii}.git && git push ssh://drewis@review.evervolv.com:8082/$(
git config --get remote.github.projectname).git jellybean-4.3:refs/heads/kitkat && popd; done

That should be it
